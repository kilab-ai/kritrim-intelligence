# Welcome to Kritrim Intelligence (KILab)

**Kritrim Intelligence**, also known as **KILab**, is an initiative focused on developing cutting-edge AI applications using **Small Language Models (SLMs)**. Our mission is to create lightweight, efficient, and privacy-conscious AI tools optimized for **consumer devices** such as **Android smartphones, tablets, and edge devices**.

> 🚧 Kritrim Intelligence is currently not a registered company or institute. This is an early-stage, experimental R&D effort that may evolve into a formal organization in the future.

## Our Vision

We envision a future where powerful AI applications are not limited to the cloud but are accessible **offline**, **on-device**, and **under user control**. By leveraging SLMs, we aim to democratize AI and make it more:

- **Efficient** – small models that run without heavy compute
- **Private** – keep your data on your device
- **Accessible** – no internet needed, no subscription required

## What We Build

Our projects include both **open-source** and **proprietary** AI applications, such as:

- 🤖 **Chat Assistants** for mobile devices
- 📝 **On-device summarizers and translators**
- 🧠 **Context-aware assistants** for education and productivity
- 🔒 **Privacy-first AI tools** with no server dependency

## Why SLMs?

Small Language Models (SLMs) allow us to deliver intelligent features in environments where:

- Network access is limited
- Privacy is critical
- Hardware is constrained

SLMs empower edge AI — and KILab is committed to pushing their capabilities further.

## Get Involved

If you’re interested in AI on the edge, small models, or privacy-first development, stay tuned as we grow. Contributions, feedback, and ideas are always welcome!
