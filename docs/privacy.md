## Introduction

OSB (Open Source Bot) is a local-first AI assistant designed to run entirely on your **Android device** using:

- 🧱 **Termux** for isolated local execution
- 🧠 **Ollama** for running Small Language Models (SLMs)
- 📱 A native Android front-end for interaction

At **Kritrim Intelligence**, we are committed to **privacy by design**. OSB is developed with the principle that your data stays on your device and under your control.

## Data Collection

We do **not** collect or transmit **any personal data**.

- ❌ No user identifiers (name, email, IP)
- ❌ No usage analytics
- ❌ No internet-based communication

## Local Execution & Responsibility

All AI processing happens **locally** on your device. OSB does **not** send data to external servers, including those operated by Kritrim Intelligence.

While OSB integrates open-source tooling like **Ollama** and **Termux**, please note:

> ⚠️ **Kritrim Intelligence is not responsible** for:
> - Any **modified or tampered language models** downloaded via Ollama
> - **Third-party model behavior**, output, or hidden data pipelines
> - The **security posture** of Termux or the Android environment you install OSB in

We recommend using only **trusted model sources** when configuring Ollama inside OSB.

## Permissions

OSB does **not request or use** any Android permissions beyond those required for local execution inside Termux.

---

## Third-Party Services

OSB does not integrate or rely on any third-party cloud APIs, services, or telemetry tools. Your data never leaves your device.

---

## Children’s Privacy

OSB does not target children and does not knowingly collect any data from individuals under the age of 16.
